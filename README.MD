# kluster
A [FOSS](https://www.freeopensourcesoftware.org/index.php/Main_Page) replacement for the decade-old amateur radio software [AR-Cluster](http://www.nc7j.com/arcluster/arusermanual-6/), written in [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org). 

### Original Copyrights
Since the original [AR-Cluster](http://www.nc7j.com/arcluster/arusermanual-6/) project hasn't been updated in 10 years and is now dormant, I hope me releasing this project is okay with the maintainers of the project. If not, my contact informations are on my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/xtrm-en) and I could take this repository down.

## Why?
My dad needed to run [AR-Cluster](http://www.nc7j.com/arcluster/arusermanual-6/) on a Raspberry PI and the original software was only available as a Windows .NET executable.

## Structure 
This project's structure is heavily based on the [AR-Cluster](http://www.nc7j.com/arcluster/arusermanual-6/) namespaced structure.

## How do I use this?
You probably don't. And even if you actually do, I don't have any fucking clue. I'm just porting this project in hope it may be useful for future DX users.

## Contribute
You don't... or at least for now. I don't like getting mangled up in my projects or just working with others in general. For now I probably won't accept pull requests but you could [take your chance](https://github.com/xtrm-en/kluster/pulls) and try anyways, if the PR is good I might just accept it.
